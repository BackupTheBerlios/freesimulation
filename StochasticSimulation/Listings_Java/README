Quick Install/Compile Guide
###########################

First: Check the 2 paths in properties.xml to the
JSci and ptplot dirs.


cd ../SimulationLib
ant
cd ../Listings_Java
ant

ant execute


Filesystem Structure
####################

All programs are sorted into subdirectories, which are
named after the chapters of the book.
Each subdir contains a build.xml file for ant (see next
paragraph).
The main dir contains also a build.xml file, which can compile
all programs in all subdirs.



Build Instructions
##################

All programs use the "ant" tool to build.
You can still use manual compilation, but it is much
easier to use the ant tool.

Ant is an Java Program to build Java projects. It is used
by executing "ant" on the command line. You can compile,
execute and produce jar files with it. Please see the ant
homepage at sourceforge (ant is a subproject of the apache
project).
To execute all programs in a subdir, call "ant execute".

To install ant look there. You should use at least Version 1.6.x,
but older versions (>1.4) should work too. If not please let me know.

We have tested the programs using Suns JDK 1.4.x, but
other 1.2/1.3/1.4 version should work too.

The SimulationLib package has its own build.xml file to
compile and deploy the lib. Just type "ant" and the jar
file will be produced.



Comments about used Packages
############################

0)
The simulation package has been renamed to 
de.berlios.StochasticSimulation.*
and is contained in its own file structure to produce an
nice jar file.

1) 
Visual Numerics Package no longer available !!

2)
Lava (Rocks) Package is no longer used, because it is shareware !
We use the Format Package from CoreJava Book Codes instead. 
It is LGPL licensed !!
A third alternative is the simulation.FMT class, copied from the 
ACME package.
-> The format code is included in the simulation lib !

3)
PtPlot is part of Ptolemy package !
Two versions available: 3.1 and 5.2 !
Everything tested with Version 3.1!

4)
JavaSci: V0.89 and higher for JDK1.3, V0.88 for JDK 1.1.8
- JSci3DGraph.java (LineGraph3D, ContourPlot)
- LevyFast (JSci.maths -> Gamma Distrib)



Comments about the Simulation Lib
#################################

Attention:
class simulation.Histogram and plot.Histogram exist !!




Still TODO
##########

- Thread.stop() suspend() and resume() deprecated in Java 1.3/4/5
- All prgs need a window resize to display itself after startup !
- RandomPoints_appl.java (Plotting of points is missing)
- 3D Plotting using JSci is not working anymore.
