This book addresses mainly undergraduate students, who are interested in the basics and
applications of Monte Carlo methods.
The graduate student or the scientist, who is already familiar with 
the basic concepts in simulations in the first few chapters, 
can gain a lot by studying the second part of the book.
These are about modern simulation techniques in non-equilibrium systems, 
many particle systems and parallel computing.
The last two chapters about simulation of open quantum systems and about 
financial problems are devoted to people who want to see how the methods 
described in the first chapters can be applied to modern problems.
