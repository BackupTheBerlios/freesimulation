\section{Programming in Java}
\label{sec:Programming}


\subsection{General considerations}
\label{sec:General_considerations}
This book is about stochastic simulation methods and their applications to
physical systems. The material is presented at an introductory level. We do 
not assume any prior knowledge on probability theory or on the theory of 
stochastic processes. We assume only the material known from the introductory 
courses in theoretical physics. The style of the presentation will be as 
informal as possible and as precise as necessary.



\subsection{Programming languages -- Why Java ?}
\label{sec:Programming_languages}
It is clear that it is not possible to teach simulation methods without 
performing some numerical experiments in the classroom and that it is 
impossible for the students to learn stochastic simulation methods without 
implementing the algorithms. Therefore, the theory and the corresponding 
algorithms will be presented in a highly interconnected (interwined), and, we 
hope, organic way.

In order to stick to this idea it was necessary to choose a programming 
language. The obvious criteria for taking such a decision are
\cite[]{GARCIA}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Powerful,
\item clean,
\item Good graphics,
\item Standard/Portable,
\item Parallelizability.
\end{enumerate}
The first criterion is of course very important because already simple 
stochastic algorithms require a considerable amount of CPU time.
A secondary aim of the course is to make the student acquainted with a 
programming language "in action" so they should learn something about a "good 
programming style" for real-life problems. Visualization of the results 
obtained allows to understand in a plastic way what is going on physically. so 
the interface between program and visualization tool/ graphical output should
be comfortable. Last not least the availability of the program should be
guaranteed. The corresponding compilers should be available at low, in the 
ideal case at no, cost to the students for home exercises. Furthermore, they
should be portable on PC with Windows or Linux operating systems, on Macintosh
and on workstations from the UNIX world (AIX, Solaris, SGI, ...).
Since almost all universities do have a high--performance parallel computer 
the language should also allow to demonstrate high--performance parallel 
algorithms.

Because of our background of convinced Fortran users we considered the 
following alternatives: our beloved Fortran, a language which is popular in 
the engineering and applied mathematics communities, MATLAB, and Java, the 
"Wunderkind" of software developers and of the Internet community. We have 
not considered C, C++ for the simple reason that we never felt the necessity 
to learn them.

All the languages considered  in some sense satisfy the above criteria. All
are more  or less portable on different platforms (at different expenses), all
allow the use of good visualization tools (at different prices), and, of 
course, all are clean. But not all are equally powerful. 

We checked the power (the efficiency) of the languages considered by the 
following benchmark, which represent the prototype of a stochastic simulation. 
We generated 100 (?) trajectories of a typical one-step stochastic process
and compared the CPU times obtained by the 3 different languages. The result
of the benchmark are summarized in the following table.

\begin{table}[htbp]

      realizations, $g(n)=0.4n, r(n)=0.5n$. On Windows 95 the JIT from
      Symantec is included and automatically used, when executing programs
      with the java command in the JDK. The TYA JIT for Linux is freely
      available and easy to install.}
    \label{tab:performance}
  \end{center}
\end{table}


Of course, in the above test we have not optimized the algorithm to the 
different platforms. Nevertheless, the table clearly shows that MATLAB is 
very slow. Even the compiled version of MATLAB is slower by a factor of x 
compared to the Fortran code. This is a good reason to disregard MATLAB!

Now we have to decide between Java and Fortran. The argument in favour of 
Java which compensates the slightly slower performance (today!, in future 
this might be different) is its portability and the free availability of the
compiler and of the visualization tools. Java runs on every platform ant 
it is available at no cost. 

Last not least, we want to mention another advantage of Java. It seems
\cite[]{bigbucks} that there is  a great need for Java programmers in 
different branches of industry today. This need will be even greater in future 
years. So learning Java, might be a kind of "life insurance" for students of 
physics. It will put them in the position to find a good (programming) job.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Java}
\label{sec:Java}

We have just seen some good reasons to choose Java as the programming language
for our purposes. Here we want to mention some more technical points, from a 
computational science point of view, in favour of Java.

Sun has described Java as follows \cite[]{javanutshell}:
\begin{quote}
Java: A simple, object--oriented, distributed, interpreted, robust, secure,
architecture neutral, portable, high--performance, multi-thread, and dynamic 
language.
\end{quote}

Let us try to understand roughly what is meant by the above adjectives.

Java is simple in the sense that the number of language constructs has been 
kept as small as necessary. For ease of migration from other languages some
basic language elements resemble C or C++. However, some features of these 
languages which were rarely used and which have been considered to be unsafe 
have been omitted. For example, in Java there is no goto statement; instead 
it has labelled break and continue statements. The preprocessor of C has been 
eliminated; the program you write is the program that the compiler sees. In 
Java there are no  operator overloading and no multiple inheritance 
features of C++.
One major simplification is that Java does not have pointers!
In Java memory is managed automatically, so the programmer is nor responsible 
for the management  of memory space. In particular Java implements an 
automatic  garbage collector.

Java is an object--oriented language and you do not have to think in a 
procedural--based way, as it is the case in Fortran for example. In order to 
solve problems in Java you have to use the notions of classes and objects. 
Every object has a class that defines its data and the methods that operate 
on these data. Classes are hierarchically arranged. A subclass inherits the 
behaviour of its superclass. A class is the basic unit of compilation
and of the execution in Java. All Java programs are classes.

Java is a distributed language, which simply means that it provides a lot of 
tools for networking. Java is the programming language of the Internet.

Java is an interpreted language. The Java compiler compiles the Java
source code into Java byte--code, which is the machine language for the Java
Virtual Machine (JVM). The JVM is an abstract machine which runs on each system
that supports Java. Other languages may also be compiled into Java byte-code.

Java is robust. Java contains features, exception handling, which simplify the
tasks of error handling and recovery.

Java is secure. Since Java has been designed for distributed applications 
high security standards have been implemented. For example, direct access to
memory is not allowed. Java contains four different levels of security 
checks and enforcements to prevent the introduction of viruses. 
In particular there is protection against deleting and modifying files.

Java is architecture neutral and portable. The byte-code format is always the 
same regardless of the platform on which the Java compiler runs. Furthermore,
there are no "implementation defined" behaviours in Java. For example, Java
specifies the size of each primitive data type. For instance, the integer 
types byte, short, int, long as 8, 16, 32 or 64--bit long, respectively.

Java is high--performance. Usually implementations of Java are used running 
Java programs interpretatively. It is however possible to run Java with a 
Just In Time (JIT) compiler. JIT compiling increases the performance of Java 
considerably.

Java is multi-thread. It supports multiple threads of execution which can 
handle different tasks. Multi-threading increases the interactive performance 
of Java.

Java is dynamic. Any Java class can be loaded into a running Java interpreter 
at any time.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Basic elements of Java}
\label{sec:Basic_elements_of_Java}
Like in other languages to write a program you first need an editor
to type the source code. Second you need a compiler to translate
the Java code to byte-code. And last, in contrast to most
traditional languages like C, C++ and Fortran, we need a virtual
machine (interpreter, called JVM) to execute the byte-code.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \begin{center}
    \leavevmode
    \includegraphics{Figures/Java_Overview.eps}
    \caption{Overview of the Java language execution model.}
    \label{fig:Java_Overview}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

So for every platform, where a virtual machine is available,
you can execute the byte-code without any compatibility problems.
But the ``look and feel'' can be different, for example Java buttons
in Windows look different from buttons in X11/Motif using a UNIX
operating system. The main reason for the wide availability of Java
is that SUN Microsystems distributes the Java Development Kit (JDK)
freely for a number of important platforms (Windows, Solaris/Linux,
other Unix systems). The JDK consists of a compiler (javac), a
debugger (jdb) and a virtual machine (java)\footnote{Actually there
are some more components like the javadoc command to create HTML
documentation or the jar tool to create zipped packages of
class files belonging together - see later on.}.

The JDK can be downloaded from the internet from the 
\href{http://www.javasoft.com}{JDK Javasoft link page}.
The newest version (as of the time of writing) is 1.1.7 and is
referred to by Java 1.1. There is already a beta version for the JDK
of the new Java 1.2 language specification. Throughout the book,
we will use the Java 1.1 version and JDK 1.1.7.

The only additional thing necessary to have a Java programming
environment is an text-editor to write the Java programs. For that
you should use your favorite editor, e.g. emacs or xemacs, which are
also freely available and have nice Java editing modes.

FreeBuilder ?????

Opposing to other languages, which use the ASCII character set, Java
uses the Unicode character set. Unicode consists of characters represented
by 2 bytes instead of 1 byte like in the ASCII set. So you can not only
use 256 different characters (ASCII) you can use all the 65535 different
characters available in the Unicode set for writing a Java program.
This means you can name your variables using for example Japanese or Greek
characters. Right from the beginning, Java is an international language.

Java is also case sensitive and doesn't need any special characters
to mark continuation lines. Comments are used just like in C and C++.
You can use either the /* \ldots */ syntax (borrowed from C) for
multi-line comments or the // syntax (borrowed from C++) for single
line comments. Additionally you can use /** \ldots */ for comments
to automatically generate a HTML documentation file for the class
defined in the file.
 
\subsection{The "HelloWorld" Program}
\label{sec:HelloWorld}
Now let's start with the traditional ``Hello World'' program written
in Java.

\subsubsection{Application}

\inputlisting{Listings_Java/HelloWorld_Application.java}
You have to save the program in a file called 
\verb|HelloWorld.java|.
To execute the above example you have to proceed as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item \marginpar[Compiler]{Compiler}
        \verb/javac HelloWorld.java/  $\Longrightarrow$ produces
        HelloWorld.class in the same directory.
\item \marginpar[JVM]{JVM}
        \verb/java HelloWorld/
\item Output on screen: \verb<Hello World !<
\end{itemize}
Let us now try to understand the above code. The program consists of
three lines. 

In the first line the program declares 
with the help of the \texttt{class} statement a class called 
HelloWorld. The identifier following the \texttt{class} statement is
the name name by which the class will be referenced. Each Java program
is a class. The curly bracket appearing after the class name
HelloWorld introduce the following class member. 


In the second line the \verb|main| method is introduced. The main
method is declared \verb|void| because the method does not return a
value. The main method is executed when you run the class as an
application. In the present case the only parameter, the argument, 
of the main method is an array of String object.

In the third line the method \verb|println| of the system class out
is invoked. This method simply prints a string and terminates with a 
new--line  command.

You have just written and executed your first application written in Java.


\subsubsection{Applet}

Java offers another possibility to execute code, so called Applets.
These are (small) Java programs, which are started by a server program,
e.g. a WWW browser like Netscape Navigator\footnote{You need at least 
version 4.06 or patches for earlier versions to use all features of Java 1.1}, 
the Internet Explorer\footnote{Seems to run Java 1.1 programs since
version 4.}(Don't),
HotJava or the appletviewer\footnote{included with the JDK.}.

The ``Hello World'' example written as an applet has the following form:
\inputlisting{Listings_Java/HelloWorld_Applet.java}
As you can see there is no main method in an applet. Instead if an applet
is started by a server, the init() method is executed first. There is also
a start() (stop()) method, which is executed if the applet becomes
visible (disappears) in the server window (e.g. by scrolling in the
Netscape Navigator window).

The paint() method appearing in the ``Hello World'' applet is
responsible for the visual part of the applet. It uses a canvas
(drawing area) with a size defined by the calling HTML file. In our case
this HTML file could look like:
\inputlisting{Listings_Java/HelloWorld_Applet.html}
The code parameter given in the HTML file defines the name of the applet
to be run. Because there is no init() and no start() method in our
example, the paint() method gets executed by the browser (or appletviewer).
The size of the canvas has to be given in pixels explicitly in the
HTML file.

To run the applet you can either type
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|appletviewer  HelloWorld.html| or
\item use the following URL in the browser: \\
        \verb|PATH_TO_CLASS_AND_HTML_FILE/HelloWorld.html| \\
        e.g. \verb|/home/user/java/HelloWorld.html|
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Variables}
\label{sec:Variables}

Essentially, Java distinguishes between two types of variables,
primitive data types and reference data types.
\subsubsection{Primitive data types}
\label{sec:primitive_data_types}
We already mentioned that in Java each variable or expression has a
definite type and that each type has identical size and behaviour on
all Java implementations.  Java has built in primitive data types
to support integer, floating--point, boolean, and character values.
The primitive data types of Java for integers, floating--points,
characters and boolean variables are listed in the table
below.
\begin{table}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l|l|l|l|l|l}
Type & Contains & Default & Size & Min & Max \\ \hline
byte  & signed integer & 0 & 8bits &   &     \\ \hline
short & signed integer & 0 & 16 bit &-32768 & 32767 \\ \hline
int &   signed integer & 0 & 32 bits&       &        \\ \hline
long & signed integer & 0 & 64 bits &       &        \\ \hline
float & floating--point & 0.0 & 32 bits &     &          \\ \hline
double & floating--point & 0.0 & 64 bits &    &        \\ \hline
boolean & true or false      &  false & 1 bit&       &  \\ \hline
char  & Unicode character & \u000 & 16 bits &      &   \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Primitive data types in Java.}
\end{table}


The following comments have to be done. In a Java program every
variable must have a type that precedes its name when the variable is
declared. For example the integer i may be declared as

\begin{quote}
int i
\end{quote}


Char values represent characters. They appear in Java between single
quotes, e.g.
\begin{quote}
char c = 'C`
\end{quote}

Float and double types have special values that may be the result of
certain floating-point operations. For example in the java.lang.Float
and java.lang.Double classes the special values
\texttt{POSITIVE INFINITY}, $\texttt{NEGATIVE INFINITY}$, and 
\texttt{NaN} (not-a-number) are
defined.

In Java strings are not a primitive type. Java provides a String
object type to deal with sequences of character data. The java string
class provides methods to operate on String objects.

\subsubsection{Reference data types}
\label{sec:Reference_data_types}

All non-primitive data types in Java are objects and arrays. They are
called also ``reference types'' because they are handled by
reference. For example you may pass the address of an object, which is
stored in a variable, to a method. In contrast, primitive types are
always passed by value.


\subsubsection{Parameters from the command line or from a html file}
The access of parameters given on the command line is as easy as it
is in C and C++. The parameters are stored as Strings in Java and
are given as the parameters to the main() method of the application.
That is the reason for the Syntax:
\begin{quotation}
  \verb|public void main(String[] args) |
\end{quotation}
It means that the array \verb|args| (see section \ref{sec:Arrays}
for an explanation of arrays) contains the parameters. Each parameter
is separated with a space in the command line. Here is an example of a 
program using command line parameters:
\inputlisting{Listings_Java/ParamCommandLine.java}
So if you run the program as \verb|java ParamCommandLine 12 34 abcd t5|
the output on the screen will be
\begin{verbatim}
 Parameter No. 0 : 12
 Parameter No. 1 : 34
 Parameter No. 2 : abcd
 Parameter No. 3 : t5
\end{verbatim}
and if you don't supply parameters it will be
\begin{verbatim}
 NO parameters specified !
\end{verbatim}

A little bit different is the behaviour of applets, because there is
no command line. But there is also a way to transmit parameters from 
the calling HTML file to the Java applet. In the HTML file you can
specify \verb|<PARAM>| attributes like here:
\inputlisting{Listings_Java/ParamApplet.html}

In this case we supply two parameters, called \verb|NumberofPoints| and
\verb|DisplayText| to the Java applet. The value is given in the string
behind the keyword \verb|value|. The Java applet to this HTML file
could look like this:
\inputlisting{Listings_Java/ParamApplet.java}

In the \verb|init()| method we get the parameter \verb|NumberofPoints|
and convert it to an integer using a wrapper method. The string 
of the parameter \verb|DisplayText| doesn't have
to be converted. Then in the \verb|paint()| method we display
the transmitted parameters on the screen. The putput in the 
appletviewer or in Netscape should look like:
\begin{verbatim}
  Parameter NumberofPoints is 10000

  Parameter DisplayText is ``This_is_a_test_parameter!"
\end{verbatim}


\subsection{Loops, Conditional Statements and simple Arithmetics}
\label{sec:Loops}
Because Java was designed to be able to load code distributed
over the whole internet, you have to avoid name conflicts
between the programs (classes). The solution in Java is to put
every class in a \emph{package}. The name of the package is given
at the beginning of a file before the actual program (class)
definition starts. So for example if we put a
\begin{quotation}
  \verb/ package de.freiburg.simulation; / 
\end{quotation}
at the beginning of the ``Hello World'' application, we can compile
the application with \verb/javac HelloWorld.java / like before.
But to run the application we have to use
\begin{quotation}
  \verb/ java de.freiburg.simulation.HelloWorld / . 
\end{quotation}
You are wondering why the program doesn´t start? It can't, because
there is one more thing to know. Java is looking for programs (classes)
in the directory structure given by the class name. So
for the example above you have to put the \verb/HelloWorld.class / file
in the directory \verb|de/freiburg/simulation/| and issue the command
in the directory, where the directory tree starts.

You could also use an environment variable called \verb|CLASSPATH|. It
describes the directories to search for the class files. So if the
\verb|CLASSPATH|-variable includes \verb|/home/user/java| you can
start the above example in this directory, if the class is in the 
subdirectory  \verb|de/freiburg/simulation/|.

All the standard commands (classes) of Java are stored in a central jar
file, which is additionally packed to save disk space. These classes
are always searched, no matter the \verb|CLASSPATH|-variable is set to.


Before learning more about the syntax of Java, we have to explain another
statement appearing in the part of any Java program before the actual
definition of the class: the \verb|import|-statement. With \verb|import|
you can make classes available, so you don't have to use the fully
qualified name to the class. So if you would like to
use the HelloWorld class from above in your programs, you could either
type \verb|de.freiburg.simulation.HelloWorld()| in your program
or you can use
\begin{verbatim}
import de.freiburg.simulation.*;
....
   HelloWorld();
\end{verbatim}
to import all classes in the \verb|de.freiburg.simulation| class.
You can also use:
\begin{verbatim}
import de.freiburg.simulation.HelloWorld;
....
   HelloWorld();
\end{verbatim}
if you just want to import one special class.

We have already made of the \verb|import|-statement in the ``Hello World'' 
applet. There we have imported the \verb|java.applet|-class, which
defines applets and their behaviour, and the \verb|java.awt|-class, which
will be explained later.
 



As we already mentioned Java  supports almost all of the the standard
C operators. The arithmetic operators that operate on numerical types
are 
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
$+$ & addition \\
$-$ & subtraction                 \\
$*$ & multiplication \\
$/$ & division \\
\% & remainder
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

It is important to remark, that in Java integer division truncates
toward zero (7/2=3).

Java has to special operators for increment $++$ and decrement $--$. The 
expression \verb|i++| is equivalent to \verb|i=i+1| except that
\verb|i| is evaluated only once.

Java supports also a standard set of relational and logical operators,
which all yield boolean values. They are listed below

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
$>$  & greater then \\
$>=$ & greater then or equal to \\
$<$  & less then \\
$<=$ & less than or equal to \\
$==$ & equal to \\
$!=$ & not equal to
\end{tabular}
\end{center}


The conditional operators
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\& \& & conditional AND      \\
||    & conditional OR
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
operate on  boolean expressions only.

Java has also bitwise operators which operate on integers and on
boolean types
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\& & and \\
| & or \\
$\tilde{}$ & not \\
$<<$ & left shift \\
$>>$ & right shift \\
$ >>>$ unsigned right shift 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Last not least we have to mention the fundamental assignment operator
$=$. It may be used in combination with other operators, e.g., $+=$
means is incremented by.

As an example we want to write a program to calculate the mean of
a given number of random numbers. One posible implemntation
could look like:
\inputlisting{Listings_Java/DataMean.java}

Here we used the class \verb|java.util.Random| which allows for
the creation of random numbers. If we don't supply a seed, as is the
case here, it just uses the time to initialize the generator. The
initialization takes place in line 10, where a new generator is created.
You can check this by running the application more than once and comparing
the means -- they should not be the same. 

The \verb|next.Double()| method returns a new random number of type
double (for a float use rand.Float()). You can also create normally 
distributed random numbers with the \verb|Random.Gauss()| method.
The rest of the program should be self explaining.
