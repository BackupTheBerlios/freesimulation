Mostly undergraduate students, who are interested in the basics and 
applications of Monte Carlo methods are mainly addressed. 
The



So to summarize, there seems to be a lack of books about Monte Carlo 
methods including non-equlibrium, quantum mechanical and non 
physics applications on an undergraduate level, which is exact enough, 
but still very applied. Together with an introduction to Java it is, what
we think, a standard book for all people interested in simulations
in statistical physics. We think it will be very appreciated by many
scientists eagerly waiting for a ``scientific'' Java introduction.
